      <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
      <p>Docker is a container platform provider company. Container platforms allow organizations to solve multiple problems across a diverse set of requirements. Containers help you to get software to run reliably when moved from one computing environment to another by consisting of an entire runtime environment: an application, plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries,  and configuration files needed to run the container. Containers differentiate themselves from virtual machines in that unlike virtual machines, a container does not require for you to pass around an entire package (containing an operating system as well as the application) for each virtual machine being run. Instead, the container runs one single operating system that is shared with other containers.</p>Sources: </p>https://www.cio.com/article/2924995/software/what-are-containers-and-why-do-you-need-them.html</p>https://www.docker.com/what-docker</p>
      <h2>What is Nginx?</h2>
      <p>Nginx is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers. Nginx was written with an explicit goal of outperforming the Apache web server.[29] Out of the box, serving static files, Nginx uses dramatically less memory than Apache, and can handle roughly four times more requests per second.[30] This performance boost comes at a cost of decreased flexibility, such as the ability to override systemwide access settings on a per-file basis</p>Sources:</p>https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/</p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx</p>
      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)?</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine is a software computer that, like a physical computer, runs an operating system and applications. The virtual machine is comprised of a set of specification and configuration files and is backed by the physical resources of a host. Every virtual machine has virtual devices that provide the same functionality as physical hardware and have additional benefits in terms of portability, manageability, and security. Among types of virtual machines we can find System Virtual Machines and Process Virtual Machines, among others, with the first type being capable of running entire operating systems, while the second type being able to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment.</p>Sources: </p>https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-50/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc_50%2FGUID-CEFF6D89-8C19-4143-8C26-4B6D6734D2CB.html.</p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine</p>
      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean?</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean is a cloud infrastructure provider that help to deploy and scale applications that run simultaneously on multiple computers DigitalOcean virtual servers or "droplets" use kernel-based virtual machines as hypervisors. Droplets are scalable compute platforms with add-on storage, security, and monitoring capabilities that run production applications. Droplets can be created in various sizes in 12 different data center regions.</p>Sources:</p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigitalOcean</p>https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/?_campaign=G|SEARCH|B|CLOUD&_adgroup=CLOUD|Cloud&_keyword=%2Bcloud%20%2Bdigital%20%2Bocean&_device=c&_copytype=Use_case&_adposition=1t1&_medium=brand_sem&_source=google&_dkitrig=&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8-ij1IjP2gIVl_5kCh2wugC3EAAYASAAEgKWYPD_BwE</p>
